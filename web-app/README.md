Perfect â€” now that you know the funnel, letâ€™s model your **data structure** based on the real-world logic of agencies.

## ðŸŒ² Recommended Data Structure (Tree View)

## ðŸ’¡ Relationships (ER View Style)

* `Student` â†’ belongs to â†’ `Intake`
* `Student` â†’ has many â†’ `Applications`
* `Application` â†’ belongs to â†’ `University`
* `Student` â†’ has many â†’ `Emails`
* `Student` â†’ has many â†’ `Documents`
* `Student` â†’ has many â†’ `Tasks / Notes`

---

This structure keeps everything clean and scalable:

* Batches group students.
* Applications are separate from student core profile.
* Email and document handling is modular.
