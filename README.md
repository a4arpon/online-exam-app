# English Therapy Platform

This project is the **backend (server side)** of an online English learning and testing platform.
It’s designed to handle everything behind the scenes: user accounts, test delivery, result tracking, and certificate generation.

I built it to:

1. **Test and explore modern backend architecture** with NestJS and Fastify.
2. Create a **solid, production-ready base** for a real platform.
3. Show how to structure a clean, maintainable project for long-term growth.

## 📝 What’s Done vs. What’s Left

* **Backend:** \~90% complete.

  * Fully functional authentication
  * Exam question management
  * Progress calculation and result storage
  * Admin panel API for managing users and certificates
  * Email service for OTP verification and notifications

* **Frontend:** \~40% complete.

  * Already has login, registration, and session handling
  * Core structure in place but missing most of the UI for exams and admin features

> If someone picks this up, they could **connect the existing backend to a finished frontend** without starting from scratch.

## 🔍 Why This Project Stands Out

If you’re hiring, here’s what this project shows about my skills:

1. **Planning and Architecture**

   * I didn’t just write code — I organized it into logical modules so features are easy to add or change later.
   * Each feature (auth, exams, certificates) is isolated in its own folder.

2. **Security Awareness**

   * Role-based access (admin, user)
   * Token-based authentication (JWT)
   * Email verification with OTP

3. **Scalability**

   * Built on **NestJS + Fastify** for better performance under heavy load.
   * Follows a modular structure so new features don’t break existing ones.

4. **Real-World Features**

   * Email integration
   * Result tracking & certificates
   * Admin tools to manage platform content

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Even without deep technical details, here’s the big picture:

* **NestJS + Fastify** — The main framework and web server
* **MongoDB + Mongoose** — Database to store users, exams, and results
* **JWT Authentication** — Secure login sessions
* **Nodemailer** — Sends OTPs and notifications by email
* **Helmet & CORS** — Basic security protections

## 📂 How It’s Organized

The backend is organized like this:

```
api-server/
├── auth-guard/        # Security checks for routes
├── decorators/        # Helpers for cleaner code
├── libs/              # Core tools (email, DB connection, env configs)
├── modules/           # Main features
│   ├── authentication
│   ├── tests
│   ├── certificates
│   ├── user
│   └── admin-*
├── schemas/           # Database models
└── main.ts            # App starting point
```

This makes it easy for another developer to find exactly where a feature lives.

## 🚀 How to Run

For a developer picking this up:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start in development mode
npm run start:dev
```

The server will start and connect to MongoDB.
API documentation is auto-generated by NestJS Swagger (available at `/docs` when running).

## 🤝 Contributing or Taking Over

If you want to:

* Finish the frontend
* Expand backend features
* Deploy to production

You can fork the repo, make changes, and submit a pull request.
I’ve kept the structure clean so onboarding is fast.
